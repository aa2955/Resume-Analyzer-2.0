## üß† How AI Is Used

This application uses Artificial Intelligence to provide deep, semantic-level analysis of resumes and job descriptions:

- **Natural Language Understanding:**  
  Utilizes BERT-based transformer models (via Hugging Face Transformers) to generate semantic embeddings of both resumes and job descriptions, capturing the true meaning beyond exact keyword matches.

- **Semantic Similarity Matching:**  
  Uses Pinecone‚Äôs vector search engine to compare resume embeddings against job descriptions and return a relevance score based on cosine similarity.

- **Skill & Keyword Extraction:**  
  Identifies missing or underrepresented skills by comparing high-weighted tokens and phrases from job listings to those in the uploaded resume.

- **Categorized Feedback Engine:**  
  AI-generated feedback is broken down into categories like experience, formatting, and skills ‚Äî helping users understand where they can improve and why.

- **Future Expansion:**  
  Plans to integrate large language models (LLMs) for conversational resume feedback and auto-improvement suggestions based on job role context.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

While the platform provides AI-powered insights, there are a few important limitations to note:

- **Generalized Scoring:**  
  The match score is based on semantic similarity and not tailored to specific industries or company preferences.

- **Static Feedback Rules:**  
  Feedback is generated using pattern-based detection and cosine thresholds ‚Äî it does not yet incorporate true contextual reasoning or deep learning interpretability.

- **Model Bias:**  
  The BERT model may reflect biases present in its training data, which could affect how resumes are interpreted and scored.

- **Limited File Handling:**  
  Currently optimized for clean, text-based PDF or Word resumes. Heavily formatted or image-based files may reduce accuracy.

- **No Human Review:**  
  The system does not replace professional resume reviews or hiring advice ‚Äî it is meant as a tool to augment, not replace, human judgment.
